# Currency Converter and API Exploration - Day 2

Welcome to Day 2 of my #100DaysOfCode journey! Today, I delved into the exciting world of APIs and mastered the art of creating a currency converter using Python.

## What I Learned

### 1. API Exploration
- Explored the concept of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
- Used the 'requests' library to make HTTP requests to external APIs.
- Gained hands-on experience in retrieving data from the Open Exchange Rates API.

### 2. Tabulate for Data Formatting
- Revised the Tabulate library, a Python tool for formatting data into tables.
- Learned how to create organized and visually pleasing tables for data presentation.

### 3. Currency Converter Challenge
- Challenged myself to build a currency converter application.
- Implemented user input to select base and target currencies.
- Made API requests to fetch up-to-date exchange rate data.
- Presented exchange rates in a clear and structured format using Tabulate.

### 4. Error Handling
- Faced and conquered API errors, gaining valuable experience in error handling and resilience.

### 5. Pagination Mastery
- Learned how to paginate data for better readability when presenting long lists of currency rates.
